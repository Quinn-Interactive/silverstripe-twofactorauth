Add extension to check for 2FA enabled at canLogIn
or
Use isPasswordExpired to lock users without a 2fa out


##Class definitions

##Controller

###CMSProfileController
Extends SilverStripe\Admin\CMSProfileController
All management of a members 2FA setting happens in getEditFrom(). 
####Changes
Move/Clone to a separate form that is front-end accessible. 

##Form

###LoginForm
Extends SilverStripe\Security\MemberAuthenticator\MemberLoginForm
Adds in 'TOTP' Security Token for QR code input. Form's doLogin action return user to log in form when user has  2FA enabled.
####Changes
Nothing now. We could try hooking here as a way of enforcing 2FA is enabled but pre-request filter likely solves this better.

###ChangePasswordForm
Extends SilverStripe\Security\MemberAuthenticator\ChangePasswordForm
**To test:** confirm intent here. It appears to enforce log out on password change forcing the user to return their 2FA, but the password is reset regardless.

##Extension

###Member
Is DataExtension
Adds DB fields:
 - Has2FA Boolean - flag for whether user has 2fa enabled
 - TOTPToken String - Hash used to generate the users 2FA codes
 - BackupTokens relationship with BackupToken - Set of one time use back up tokens

generateQRCode() is used by CMSProfileController for 2FA set up
validateTOTP() used on LoginForm for authentication


##Model

###BackupToken

##Migration - BackupToken
Deprecation pending class for updating the namespace of the backup tokens
